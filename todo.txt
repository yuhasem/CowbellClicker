Cowbell Clicker:

Next todos:

Something akin to Golden Cookies? Need an image.(Angelic Cowbell? akin to click frenzy: ridiculously good but ridiculously rare)
Click Tracks - stalling
Prestige (need to test hard reset, other than that, this should be good)
Saving
Get the midbar to go all the way down
In desperate need of balancing.
Achievement popups/Notifications


Why does it take multiple clicks to select upgrades sometimes?
	It was the element being refreshed -> changing the event combined with holding the mouse down over the ui tick
The game loop died while I was tabbed out?
Production bonus seems to last a lot shorter than 60 seconds?
	(Is the time being subtracted twice?) Nope
	It was updateTime() setting .ended after .screenTime reached 0 regardless of .started state


Bands with Cowbell:
War - Low Rider
Nazareth - Hair of the Dog
Blue Oyster Cult - Don't Fear the Reaper
Rolling Stones - Honkey Tonk Woman
Run DMC - King of Rock
